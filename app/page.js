            We believe people give away the process, their bycode, going on in their mind by how they interact with the world. So if you know what to look out for you can quickly understand what makes someone tick.

            A bycode is not a physical part of someone's body, rather an abstracted model of their repeated themes.<br/>Each bycode is built from 4 layers:

            An easy place you could see a person's bycode be used is when they are placed into a new location.
            For example, do they quickly search around all the new exciting things that surround them or do they start clumping the things into the categories they know?

          The reflexes, stances and many other factors have their concept originate from them, and for that we thank them for sharing such insightful information open source. <br/> Without them this would never have been created.

          Some definitions have shifted, and will not correlate with what Jung intended. To avoid confusion they have been given new names and labels.
